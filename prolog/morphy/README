README file for 'morphy'

morphy is a simple reverse morphology tool that relies on an installed WordNet database. 

Given a word and POS, morphy will return base forms.

The Makefile provided looks for the file 'wnlib.a', which is part of the standard WordNet database package,
in the directory $LIBDIR, which is $WNHOME/src/lib. Generally, after a successful installation of the WordNet
database package, $WNHOME is set correctly, but you may have to tweak some environment and/or Makefile 
variables to get the Makefile to work on your computer.

To run morphy, you will have to be sure that morphy can find the WordNet database. Again, after a successful installation
of WordNet, usually the environment variable is set correctly. If need be, set $WNSEARCHDIR to point to the
directory that contatins the WordNet database files (*.data and *.index).
